* libmotor_shm: a library providing user space access to shared memory
  used by the motor_ctl driver.

* motor_comm: a python packag which provides a user space
  communication w/ the motor_ctl hard real-time (RTAI) driver. In
  addition it provides a suit of commandline functions for controlling
  a robot using the motor_ctl driver.

* motor_shm: a python ctypes wrapper around the libmotor_shm
