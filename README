===========================================

motor_control software provides motor control and data aquisition
capabilities for the upgraded Bride of Robofly System (BORF) and
possibly for the Original Robofly system (ORF). The motor_control 
software consists of 

* motor_ctl: a hard realtime driver implemented as an RTAI kernel
  module. The module provides realtime motor control and data
  acquisition.

* libmotor_shm: a library providing user space access to shared memory
  used by the motor_ctl driver.

* motor_comm: provides a user space communication w/ the motor_ctl
  hard real-time (RTAI) driver. In addition to a python package it
  provides a suit of commandline functions for controlling a robot
  using the motor_ctl driver.

* motor_shm: a python ctypes wrapper around the libmotor_shm
  library. It is used for communication with the motor_ctl hard
  real-time (RTAI) driver.
