==============================================

Stability problem. The current incarnation of borf_control has a
pretty serious stability issue which causes it to hard lock
intermittently. I'm not sure what is causing this - it may have
something to do with shared memory usage. This set of notes has been
started to help me keep track of my debugging effort. 

A couple of ideas. 

* I think the stability problem has to due with shared memory as the
  problem typically seems to occur when access or freeing the shared
  memory between the realtime driver and the user space library. 

  One thought is that I need to use mlock on the shared memory buffers.
  
  A second idea is that it is a race condition. I might try commenting
  out all spin locks in motor_ctl driver. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Found that rt_global_heap_open() is required for user space
  processes using shared memory.

  In motor_shm.c I've added a rt_global_heap_open() to the section of
  code just after the rt_shm_alloc's and a rt_global_heap_close() the
  the section just after the rt_shm_free's.

  This didn't seem to fix the problem and stress.py still hard locks
  the system after running about 20-40 kinematic patterns. The final
  command on the debuggin outout was *cmd2motor_ctl set-os-buffer.
  I'm going to check this out.  

  In addition becuase of the hard locks I should back up all the debs
  required to make this system. and all the src packages.
