==============================================

Stability problem. The current incarnation of borf_control has a
pretty serious stability issue which causes it to hard lock
intermintently. I'm not sure what is cuasing this - it may have
somethine to do with shared memory usage. This set of notes has been
started to help me keep track of my debugging effort. 

A couple of ideas. 

* I think the stability problem has to due with shared memory as the
  problem typically seems to occur when access or freeing the shared
  memory bewteen the realtime driver and the user space library. 

  One thought is that I need to ue mlock on the shared memory buffers.
